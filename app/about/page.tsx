          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Content Creator's Toolkit began when our founder, a content marketer, realized how much time was spent
            switching between different tools and platforms to create content. The idea was simple: what if all the
            essential tools for content creation were available in one place?
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            After months of development and testing with professional content creators, we launched our platform with a
            focus on simplicity, efficiency, and quality. Today, thousands of content creators rely on our toolkit to
            streamline their workflow and produce better content.
